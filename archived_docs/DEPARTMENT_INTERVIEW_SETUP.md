## Next Steps
1. ✅ Update EE preparation.html with videos
2. ⏳ Create/update EE interview.html with full MCQ quiz
3. ⏳ Create EE ai-interview.html with department-specific questions
4. ⏳ Repeat for ME, CE, EC departments
5. ⏳ Create corresponding ai-report.html pages
6. ⏳ Update all navigation menus to include AI Interview links

## Template Structure
Each department needs:
1. **preparation.html** - 16 video cards (4x4 grid) with department-specific content
2. **interview.html** - MCQ quiz system with 3 topics × 3 levels (9 question sets)
3. **ai-interview.html** - Copy of CS version with:
   - Department code (EE/ME/CE/EC)
   - Department-specific question banks
   - Same camera/emotion/WPM features
4. **ai-report.html** - Dark-themed report (copy CS version, update department ref)

## Data Storage
- Traditional interviews: `traditional_interviews/{dept}/{uid}/{sessionId}`
- AI interviews: `interviews/{uid}/{sessionId}` (with department field)
- Reports accessible via department-specific report.html pages
